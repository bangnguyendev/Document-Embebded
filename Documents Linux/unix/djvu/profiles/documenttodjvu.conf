############### HEADER PROFILES #########################################
### First we define header profiles.  Header profiles are not intended
### to be used directly, but instead are suppose to be inherited by other
### profiles.


##################
### RESOLUTION ###
##################
## These header profile define how the scaling of the mask, the foreground
## and the background occur as a function of the resolution.
## They have been designed for SCANNED documents.
##
## We also set here resolution dependent parameters for the segmenter.
## render-size: any character with #render_size# or less pixels will be
## removed. 
##
## edge-size: Defines the thickness (in pixel) of character edges, where
##   the color is unreliable
## blurring-size: size (in pixel) of blurring convolutions applied in the
##   segmenter.
##
## These parameters have been tuned only in the case of normal quality
## scanned document, and they are the default parameters.
##
## For non-scanned document, or scanned document requiring fast or
## aggressive compression, we prefer resolution independent parameters
## for two reasons:
##   1. Segmentation is easier, and parameters are less critical
##   2. It would represent too much testing and tuning time.

# For 300 - 600 DPI scaling there is no need to upsample the mask
